# Monetization Analysis

### 1. How can we improve subscriber retention? Propose 3 ideas per both product improvements and enhancing monetization techniques.

**Improvements in Products:**
- Working on app usability of Desktop devices to reduce churn rate.
- Working on the user data to increase the value of the subscription for customers (like Spotify does with the wrapper at the end of the year), aiming to reduce the churn rate, mainly on the yearly subscribers.
- Making a partnership with Spotify so users can learn their favorite songs based on Spotify data. This initiative aims to increase customer retention.

**Monetization techniques:**
- Offering other types of side-courses to complement the average ticket of the customers. <br>
_i.e: mixing course, bass for jazz, piano for country music, composition_
- In-app advertising.
- Progressive discount as users renew their subscription, aiming to expand the LTV through more renewals.
- Exploring revenue-sharing with music stores for them to use the app to promote themselves, or even allowing users to purchase their products without leving the app.
- Introducing loyalty programs that reward customers with personalized discounts or exclusive offers, mainly those with yearly subscriptions or on their 12th renewal.


### 2. How can LTV be used to inform monetization strategies and experiments?
By incorporating LTV into our monetization strategies and experiments we can maximize the long-term profitability of our customer base. 
It allows for targeted efforts, efficient resource allocation, and continuous improvement based on customer behavior and value.

These are some ways that LTV can be helpful in our monetization strategies:
- Identifying high-value and low-value customer segments
- Maximizing company profit by comparing the LTV with the cost of acquisition (CAC) to allocate budget and resources to channels that attract customers with higher long-term value
- Identifying opportunities for cross-selling and upselling to existing customers, recommending additional products or premium services to customers with higher LTV to increase their overall spending.

At the same time, we can also use LTV as the metric to track our strategies and see if they are going well or need some adjustments.

### 3. How price optimization might help to improve monetization efficiency?
By helping to find the right balance between customer value and business profitability, with the object of setting prices that align with market and customer expectations.
In markets with high demand elasticity, we have higher price sensitivity, that is, tiny adjustments in the product's price can produce big outcomes, either bad or good ones.

Because of that, we must analyze the price sensitivity before making changes to it. If everything goes right, a slightly lower price can produce a huge impact on the number of new subscriptions and/or the LTV metric, as the customer can feel more incentivized to renew his subscription according to his perception of the product value.

### 4. How would you decide where to differentiate the prices and how would you arrange the pricing experiment(-s)? What metrics would you use, how would you evaluate the results?
I would take a look at the countries where the customer's average lifetime is lowest and start the price experiment from there, assuming the reason behind a short average lifetime is the customer's perception of the product value.

Since the app helps people learn music, we can try changing prices in countries where the subscription cost is a big part of what someone spends on education. This helps us figure out if the subscription price matches what the company wants to achieve.

But if the app is more for fun than learning, all of the previous analysis should be done comparing with the individual entertainment budget.


**Price arrangement:**

As mentioned in the lifetime_value notebook, we might consider lowering the subscription price in the US. This could have a bigger impact there because the US dollar is worth less than the euro.
To start we would decrease the price in a marketing campaign to see the price sensitivity and, depending on the results, decrease the overall price in US.

**Metrics:**

To evaluate the results I would use:
- **LTV:** to see if the customers are spending more money throughout their lifetime
- **Basket composition**: to see the composition of customer average ticket and evaluate if the rise of LTV is caused by more renewals or by cross-selling products.
- **New subscriptions:** to measure the customer's sensitivity over the new subscription price.
- **Overall revenue by country:** to see if the US is still the country where most of the revenue comes from.
