# Monetization Analysis

### 1. How can we improve subscriber retention? Propose 3 ideas per both product improvements and enhancing monetization techniques.

**Products improvements:**
- Working on app usability of Desktop devices, to decrease churn rate.
- Working on the user data to make their subscription valuable (like Spotify does with the wrapper at the end of the year), aiming to decrease the churn rate, mainly on the yearly subscribers.
- Making a partnership with Spotify so the users can learn their favorite songs according to the Spotify data. This movement aims to increase customer retention.

**Monetization techniques:**
- Offering other types of side-courses to compose the average ticket of the customers. <br>
_i.e: mixing course, bass for jazz, piano for country music, composition_
- In-app advertising (not like YouTube where ads annoy the user, but through in-app banners)
- Progressive discount, as the users renew their subscription, aiming to expand the LTV through more renewals.
- Applying revenue share with music stores, who could use the app to promote itself, or even make possible to the user to purchase their products without to move to its website.
- Applying some loyalty programs that reward loyal customers with personalized discounts or exclusive offers, mainly those with yearly subscriptions, or are on the 12th renewal.


### 2. How can LTV be used to inform monetization strategies and experiments?
By incorporating LTV into our monetization strategies and experiments we can maximize the long-term profitability of our customer base. 
It allows for targeted efforts, efficient resource allocation, and continuous improvement based on customer behavior and value.

These are some ways that LTV can be helpful in our monetization strategies:
- Help to identify high-value and low-value customer segments
- Maximize the company's profit by comparing the LTV with the cost of acquiring (CAC) to allocate budget and resources to channels that attract customers with higher long-term value
- Help to identify opportunities for cross-selling and upselling to existing customers, recommending additional products or premium services to customers with higher LTV to increase their overall spending.

At the same time, we can also use LTV as the metric to track our strategies and see if they are going well or need some adjustments.

### 3. How price optimization might help to improve monetization efficiency?
By helping to find the right balance between customer value and business profitability, with the object of setting prices that align with market and customer expectations.
In markets with high demand elasticity, we have higher price sensibility, that is, tiny adjustments in the product's price can produce big outcomes, either bad or good ones.

Because of that, we must analyze the price sensibility before making changes to it. If everything goes right, a slightly lower price can produce a huge impact on the number of new subscriptions and/or the LTV metric, as the customer can feel more incentivized to renew his subscription according to his perception of the product value.

### 4. How would you decide where to differentiate the prices and how would you arrange the pricing experiment(-s)? What metrics would you use, how would you evaluate the results?
I would take a look at the countries where the customer's average lifetime is lowest and start the price experiment from there, assuming the reason behind a short average lifetime is the customer's perception of the product value.

As the app's function is to help people learn music, another starting point for price experiments could be those countries where the weight of the subscription price over the individual education budget is heavy. This can be a nice pricing measurement to indicate if the subscription price is aligned with the company's goal.

But if the app is more to entertainment than education, all of the previous analysis should be done comparing with the individual entertainment budget.



**Price arrangement:**

As was mentioned in the lifetime_value notebook, I could start decreasing the subscription price in US, because in there the impact of this movement can be higher, as its currency is less valued than the euro.
To start I would decrease the price in a marketing campaign to see the price sensibility and, depending on the results, I would start decreasing the overall price in US.

**Metrics:**

To evaluate the results I would use:
- **LTV:** to see if the customers are spending more money throughout their lifetime
- **Basket composition**: to see the composition of customer average ticket and evaluate if the rise of LTV is caused by more renewals or by cross-selling products.
- **New subscriptions:** to measure the customer's sensibility over the new subscription price
- **Overall revenue by country:** to see if the US is still the country where most of the revenue comes from.
